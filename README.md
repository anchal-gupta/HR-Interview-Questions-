# HR-Interview-Questions-

### Introduce yourself.
-        Include your name and basic details in this section.
-        Basic details can include your qualification, area of interests, hobbies, strengths, etc.
-        Be precise in giving your answer, as introduction question is only to judge your communication skills and it’s about getting a basic idea about the kind of person you are.

### Why should we hire you?
-        While answering such question, focus on telling about the strengths of yours that are different from others.
-        Qualities that can describe your  strengths can be- punctuality, trustworthiness, creative, dedicated, etc..
-        Take them in confidence that all the qualities they are looking for in a candidate, are possessed by you.
### What are your weakness?
-        Don’t be too honest while answering this.
-        Tell them about your weakness along with the steps you are taking to improve it.
-        Never be diplomatic in this answer by opting strengths as your weakness such as- i am very helpful and i can’t say no to others when someone asks for help, or I am  very sincere towards my work due to which i take more time to complete a project as i don’t want any errors in it later.
-        All these answers are really common and HR’s already know that students will come up with these kind of weaknesses.
-        Therefore, try to give an honest answer like that of- I have problem while communicating in English and for that i am taking online English speaking tutorials, or I have audience fear and i get nervous while speaking infront of audience; to overcome this, I try to grab all the opportunities of presentation, debates or any such event that involves speaking in public.
### If we reject you, what would you do?
-        Start this answer with a slight smile so that you seem to be a positive person.
-        Form your answer by including that you will like to know from them ( HR’s ) , the reason of your rejection and then you would like to work on those reasons so that you can improve yourselves.
-        Also specify,- Meanwhile, if you will get any other opportunity, you would try there.
-        Never get panic while answering such question by thinking about the consequences.
-         HR’s intention to ask such question is to judge your situation based skills.
### What are your  salary expectations?
-        If you are a fresher, never disclose the amount of salary you are expecting
-        To answer this, go for it like – being a fresher, salary is not a priority for me. I am expecting a amount that can fulfil my needs. I want to join this company for knowledge and experience rather than money.
-        If you are a experienced candidate, then you can demand for salary you are expecting. Moreover, you can also mention about the salary you were getting in your previous company.
